# Starter
A starter repo to get you up and running with a new project. This repo includes utilizes:

- Poetry as a package manager
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD Pipeline
- Dockerfile
- Makefile
- Tests

I personally use this repo as it's a nice starting point for most new projects I start working on. Feel free to use it as well!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.8+
- Poetry
- Make

With that, you should be good to go!

### Installation

I recommend you fork this repo and then clone it down to your local machine. Once you have the repo locally, you can start by running the following commands:

```bash
make install
```

> Note, if you don't want the base dependencies, feel free to adjust the pyproject.toml file to your needs.


## Future Improvements

- Semantically version the project with [python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package.
